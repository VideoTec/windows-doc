waveOutPrepareHeader
-------------------------------------------

The waveOutPrepareHeader function prepares a waveform-audio data block for playback.

MMRESULT waveOutPrepareHeader(

waveOutUnprepareHeader
-------------------------------------------

The waveOutUnprepareHeader function cleans up the preparation performed by the waveOutPrepareHeader function.

This function 两个必须
must be called after the device driver is finished with a data block. You 
must call this function before freeing the buffer.

After passing a buffer to the device driver with the waveOutWrite function, 
you must wait until the driver is finished with the buffer before calling waveOutUnprepareHeader.
参考
Before calling waveOutClose, the application must wait for all buffers to finish playing or call the waveOutReset function to terminate playback.

Unpreparing a buffer that has not been prepared has no effect, and the function returns zero.

MMRESULT waveOutUnprepareHeader(
  HWAVEOUT hwo,   Handle to the waveform-audio output device.
  LPWAVEHDR pwh,  Pointer to a WAVEHDR structure identifying the data block to be cleaned up.
  UINT cbwh       Size, in bytes, of the WAVEHDR structure.
