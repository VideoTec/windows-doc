The waveOutClose function closes the given waveform-audio output device.

MMRESULT waveOutClose(
  HWAVEOUT hwo
);

---------------------------
和其它接口的关系
---------------------------
The close operation fails if the device is still playing a waveform-audio buffer that was previously sent by calling waveOutWrite. 
Before calling waveOutClose, the application must wait for all buffers to finish playing or call the waveOutReset function to terminate playback.

参考
you must wait until the driver is finished with the buffer before calling waveOutUnprepareHeader.
